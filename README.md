## DESCRIPTION:
These are the configuration files I wrote for the Linux system monitoring program "Conky."
They include System, CPU, RAM, Disk, VPN, Tor, and notebook battery information.

## INSTALL Git and Conky

To download and use or modify on your Linux box, you will need to install git if it is not already provided by your distribution.

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint and variants: 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git.
```
You will also need to install `conky` with the same commands that you used for git. 

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint and variants: 
```bash
sudo apt install conky-all
```
If you are a newb and need GUI for easy operation.

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint and variants: 
```bash
sudo apt install conky-manager2
```
## DOWNLOAD
Then type the following into the same terminal or just copy and paste (root powers not needed):
```bash  
 git clone https://github.com/MrGhost6666/CipherWatch 
 ```
